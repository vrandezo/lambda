# lambda CLI

A command line interface to Wikifunctions (or any other WikiLambda
installation).

The CLI currently only has an interactive mode which is started using

node src/lambda.js

Then, entering an existing ZID, it loads that ZObject from notwikilambda and
displays it with all ZIDs and key IDs replaced by English labels.

The plans of what this tool should be able to do is described in
FUTURE_README.md
